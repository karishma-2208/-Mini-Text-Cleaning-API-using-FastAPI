# -Mini-Text-Cleaning-API-using-FastAPI
## Project Overview
This project is part of a 4-week internship program.  
In **Week 4**, we built a **Mini REST API** using **FastAPI** to demonstrate how AI or text preprocessing models can be deployed in the backend.
The API cleans input text by:
- Converting text to lowercase  
- Removing punctuation  
- Removing stopwords (common words like “and”, “the”, “is”, etc.)

##  Features
 Simple FastAPI web app  
 Cleans and preprocesses text  
 Returns output instantly as JSON  
 Interactive Swagger UI interface at `/docs`
 
##  Learning Outcome
By completing this project, I learned:
- How to create and run a FastAPI application  
- How backend APIs work for AI model deployment  
- How text preprocessing is automated for NLP tasks  

##  Installation Requirements
 The following Python libraries for this project:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn nltk pydantic
